# Discordmium

Warning: This is meant for self-use only. You should not host this and make it publicly available to users, as they have full control over a browser inside your PC, as well as network information and user agent.

## ü§® ‚óè What the hell is this?
Discordmium brings the Chromium browser instance in Discord, of course limited to the Discord API.

Now that the bot has been set up, the token can now be used to run Discordmium!
